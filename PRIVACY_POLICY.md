This Privacy Policy explains how the Whats Messenger Chrome extension ("we", "our", or "extension") handles user data. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have a positive experience when using our extension.

## Data Collection and Storage

### What We Collect

The Whats Messenger extension may collect and store the following information:

### How We Store Data

- All data collected by the extension is stored **locally** on your device using browser storage mechanisms (localStorage, IndexedDB).
- We do **not** transmit or store your data on our servers.
- Your data remains on your device and is only processed locally.

## Data Usage

The data collected is used solely for the following purposes:

1. To send messages through WhatsApp Web as directed by you.
2. To populate message templates with contact information.
3. To maintain a history of sent messages and their status.
4. To preserve your settings and preferences for future use.

## Data Sharing

- We do **not** share your data with any third parties.
- We do **not** use analytics services to track your usage.
- Your data is only sent to WhatsApp Web when you explicitly initiate a message send action.

## WhatsApp Web Interaction

- This extension interacts with WhatsApp Web to send messages on your behalf.
- We do not have access to your WhatsApp account credentials.
- All communication with WhatsApp Web happens locally in your browser.

## User Control Over Data

You have complete control over your data:

- You can delete message history, templates, and contact information at any time through the extension interface.
- You can clear all extension data by clearing your browser's storage for this extension.
- Uninstalling the extension will remove all stored data from your device.

## Security

- We implement appropriate security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access.
- Since data is stored locally, the security of your data is also dependent on your device's security.
